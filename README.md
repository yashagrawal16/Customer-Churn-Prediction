# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction (Telecom Sector)

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts whether a telecom customer will **churn** (leave the service) or not, based on their usage, billing, and demographic data.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (EDA & Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (ML models, pipelines)
- Random Forest, Logistic Regression
- Joblib (model saving)

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Customer_churn_completed.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with code
- `requirements.txt` → Dependencies
- `your_dataset.csv` → Dataset 
- `README.md` → Project documentation

## 🚀 Results
- Achieved **85% accuracy** using Random Forest.
- ROC-AUC: 0.89
- Identified key churn drivers: contract type, monthly charges, tenure, etc.
